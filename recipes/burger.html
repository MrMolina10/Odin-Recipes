    <h1>Best Burger</h1>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Beef is delicious on its own – it is a high-quality protein that is tender, juicy and full of natural flavor. You don’t need a bunch of mix-ins, or you’re just masking the flavor of the beef. Remember it’s not a meatloaf, but a burger. If you want to change up the flavor, do that with the amazing burger sauces below (you’ll want to try these!) and toppings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup rolled oats</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the beef, onion soup mix, egg, hot sauce and oats. Shape into 6 patties.</li>
        <li>Grill patties over medium high heat for 10 to 20 minutes, or to desired doneness.</li>
    </ol>
